An Important Note

Please be aware that during all Online plays, be it Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Challenges or Super Challenges, pressing the ESC button will NOT pause the game. The timer and all in-game events will continue normally. That is because pausing online doesn't actually pause the game.

The reason behind that is that pausing the game causes the game to stop ALL events and not just game-related events. Some of these stopped events include incoming and outgoing connections. This causes loss of connection to Platinum Online.
