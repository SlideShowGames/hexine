Online: Login Interface

Assuming you have not set Auto-Login in the Options, this screen is the first you'll meet when you enter the leaderboards.
This screen shows you the amount of players currently online on the top left, and asks for a Username and Password. You can tick a checkbox to remember your password. Pressing the Login button then logs you in to Marble Blast Platinum Online.
You can also log in as a Guest by pressing the Guest button. Guests cannot write to other users anywhere, have no statistics tracked, and their times, scores and achievements are not recorded.
Press the Home button to go back to the Main Menu.

The Create Account button allows you to create an account for both the website and Marble Blast Platinum Online. It asks for a Username and Password of your choice, as well as an e-mail. You MUST provide a working e-mail, as you will be sent an activation key that, without it, you won't be able to login.
Please read the Terms of Service, and tick the checkbox on the bottom.

If your version is lower than the one on the server, you will be asked to download the latest version.
