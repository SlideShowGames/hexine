Marble Blast Platinum - Help

Welcome! This is the help section of Marble Blast Platinum (MBP).

This section does NOT repeat anything that is said in any levels (basic rolling movement, hazards, etc.), or explains objects like Easter Eggs and Checkpoints, or what is an Ultimate Score, as they are all considered basic knowledge that can be understood by just playing the game.

This section, however, will explain our recommendation for new players of Marble Blast, as in the recommended order to play levels, a detailed explanation of every button in most interfaces, and what you can access. Likewise, the options menu will be explained in detail with our recommendations, and additionally we will reveal the hidden preferences that one may change to further enhance MBP.  To top it all off, a number of useful guides are included towards the end.

If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to either ask us on the forums or e-mail us at marbleblastforums@gmail.com
