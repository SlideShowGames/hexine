BoxedWine 20.1.2

* 64-bit Windows installer will now default to the correct Programe Files to install to.
* Added about 30 more supported extensions to OpenGL.
* Fixed fstat system call, it will now will report the correct size of the file
* Added SSE2 support for both the x64 and normal cores
* Fixed crash in custom winex11.drv and updated file systems to use it
* Launching Boxedwine without any command line arguments will now launch a new UI.  As long as the platform support OpenGL it should work with the UI.

Known game fixes

* GOG's Diablo + Hellfire - https://www.gog.com/game/diablo
  The installer works, the launcher works and Diablo works.  Hellfire does not work (same as Wine).
