The following Wine file systems are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/boxedwine/files/FileSystems/Split/v5/

Wine-5.0
Wine-4.0
Wine-3.1
Wine-2.0
Wine-1.9
Wine-1.8
Wine-1.7
Wine-1.6 (might have some issues with this one)

I included Wine-5.0 in this release because it is the most recent verion.

I also included Wine-1.7 since it is a smaller file system and because it starts up faster than Wine-5.0

Start time for the Full Tilt! Demo on my computer with x86 BoxedWine

Wine-5.0 22 seconds
Wine-1.7  8 seconds
