<h1>Corkey Corrupt extensions</h1>
<h2>does indeed include power washing the Chromebook, which wipes local data including everything under "My files," so I suggest you select everything you want to drag and back up to Google Drive if that's available for your account</h2>
<p>Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page), or you can just powerwash.</p>
<p>Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi and do refresh+power to (instant restart)</p>
<p>Log back into your Chromebook with the WiFi off. Look for an option to log in as an existing user and click that.</p>
<p>Go to chrome://extensions, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school's blocking extension to appear.</p>
<p>As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted or doesn't appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)</p>
<p>If it didn't work, start over. You have to be fast.</p>
